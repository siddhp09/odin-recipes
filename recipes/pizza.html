    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> The following method I patched together from recipes in both Joy of Cooking and Cook's Illustrated's The Best
        Recipe. The pizza dough recipe makes enough dough for two 10 to 12 inch pizzas.

        Next time I'll be a bit more patient with stretching out the dough so I can get it even thinner. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water
            and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't
            dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active
            and alive. </li>
        <li>
            Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a
            minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.

            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.

            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more
            flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.

            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
            
            Cover the dough with plastic wrap. 
        </li>

    </ol>
