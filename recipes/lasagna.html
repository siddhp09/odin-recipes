    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/Classic-Lasagna-14-scaled.jpg" alt="Photo of a plate of lasagna" width="300">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in
        crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
        seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
        occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
        cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat
        layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
        spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </p>
